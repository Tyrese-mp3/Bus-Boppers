# Custom 3D Models for the Game

This folder is where you can place your custom 3D models for the game. The game supports the following model formats:
- GLTF/GLB (recommended)
- OBJ
- FBX
- DAE (Collada)

## Required Model Files

Place your model files in this folder with these exact names:

1. `player.glb` - Your player character model
2. `obstacle.glb` - Your obstacle models
3. `coin.glb` - Your collectible models

## Model Requirements

For best results, follow these guidelines:
1. Keep models relatively low-poly for better performance
2. Models should be properly scaled (the game will auto-scale them)
3. Include textures and materials in your model files
4. For GLTF/GLB format, you can include animations
5. Test your models in a 3D viewer before using them in the game
